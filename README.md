# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Projects
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images through layers of convolutional filters, making them highly effective for image classification, object detection, and other visual tasks.


## Projects
## Project 1: [House Price](https://github.com/elenshahbazyan/CNN/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction/House%20(1).ipynb) Prediction 
### Description
This project uses a Kaggle dataset to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, and more. The model applies CNNs in a regression context to predict continuous values like house prices.The project consists of several important steps that need to be followed to achieve the best results:

1. Train the Model for House Price Prediction
We will train a machine learning model to predict house prices using the Kaggle dataset.

2. Preprocess the Dataset
The dataset needs to be preprocessed by cleaning it, handling missing values, and scaling the features as required.

3. Build and Tune the Model Architecture
We need to design and implement a model architecture that is appropriate for the task, ensuring the model has the potential to achieve high accuracy.

4. Optimize Hyperparameters
We will experiment with various hyperparameter combinations to achieve the best possible performance for our model.

5. Evaluate the Model
The model will be evaluated on both training and validation datasets. The evaluation will include:
-Loss graphs (training/validation loss)
-Performance metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)

6. Save the Model
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, we will save it to a file so that it can later be loaded for inference on new data.

## Reference
In this project, we aim to train a model to predict house prices based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset is available from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset?resource=download


## Project 2: [CIFAR-10](https://github.com/elenshahbazyan/CNN/blob/main/CIFAR10/CIFAR10.ipynb) Image Classification
### Description
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to build a CNN model that can classify images into one of these 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
