# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Projects
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images through layers of convolutional filters, making them highly effective for image classification, object detection, and other visual tasks.


## Projects
## Project 1: [House Price Prediction] (https://github.com/elenshahbazyan/CNN/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction/House%20(1).ipynb)
### Description
This project uses a Kaggle dataset to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, and more. The model applies CNNs in a regression context to predict continuous values like house prices.
## Project 2: [CIFAR-10](https://github.com/elenshahbazyan/CNN/blob/main/CIFAR10/CIFAR10.ipynb) Image Classification
### Description
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to build a CNN model that can classify images into one of these 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
